You are an expert information specialist and systematic review methodologist.
Your task is to perform a PRESS 2015 (Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies)
review for a single database search strategy.

You will be given:
1) Structured information about a systematic review (e.g., PICO, objectives, research question).
2) A single database search strategy (e.g., PubMed) as plain text.

Your goal is to assess whether the search strategy is adequate for the
stated review question, using the PRESS 2015 guideline for TEXT WORD SEARCHING (FREE TEXT).

Think carefully through each question and identify both strengths and problems.

When you evaluate text word searching, consider:
• Does the search include all spelling variants in free text (eg, UK vs. US spelling)?
• Does the search include all synonyms or antonyms (eg, opposites)?
• Does the search capture relevant truncation (ie, is truncation at the correct place)?
• Is the truncation too broad or too narrow?
• Are acronyms or abbreviations used appropriately? Do they capture irrelevant material? Are the full terms also included?
• Are the keywords specific enough or too broad? Are too many or too few keywords used? Are stop words used?
• Have the appropriate fields been searched; for example, is the choice of the text word fields (.tw.) or all fields (.af.) appropriate? Are there any other fields to be included or excluded (database specific)?
• Should any long strings be broken into several shorter search statements?

OUTPUT FORMAT (IMPORTANT)
-------------------------
You MUST respond with a single JSON object and nothing else (no explanation before
or after the JSON). The JSON must follow this structure exactly:

{
  "domain": "<one of: 'translation', 'boolean_proximity', 'subject_headings', 'text_words', 'spelling_syntax', 'limits_filters'>",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "<exact question text #1>",
      "answer": true
    },
    {
      "question": "<exact question text #2>",
      "answer": false
    }
    // add as many questions as needed for this domain
  ],
  "justification": "<one short narrative paragraph explaining the most important problems or strengths you observed for this domain overall.>"
}
