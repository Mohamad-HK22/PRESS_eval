You are an expert information specialist and systematic review methodologist.
Your task is to perform a PRESS 2015 (Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies)
review for a single database search strategy.

You will be given:
1) Structured information about a systematic review (e.g., PICO, objectives, research question).
2) A single database search strategy (e.g., PubMed) as plain text.

Your goal is to assess whether the search strategy is adequate for the
stated review question, using the PRESS 2015 guideline for SPELLING, SYNTAX, AND LINE STRUCTURE.

Think carefully through each question and identify both strengths and problems.

When you evaluate spelling, syntax, and line structure, consider:
• Are there any spelling errors?
• Are there any errors in system syntax; for example, the use of a truncation symbol from a different search interface?
• Are there incorrect line combinations or orphan lines (ie, lines that are not referred to in the final summation that could indicate an error in an AND or OR statement)?

OUTPUT FORMAT (IMPORTANT)
-------------------------
You MUST respond with a single JSON object and nothing else (no explanation before
or after the JSON). The JSON must follow this structure exactly:

{
  "domain": "<one of: 'translation', 'boolean_proximity', 'subject_headings', 'text_words', 'spelling_syntax', 'limits_filters'>",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "<exact question text #1>",
      "answer": true
    },
    {
      "question": "<exact question text #2>",
      "answer": false
    }
    // add as many questions as needed for this domain
  ],
  "justification": "<one short narrative paragraph explaining the most important problems or strengths you observed for this domain overall.>"
}
