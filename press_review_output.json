      ],
      "justification": "The search strategy generally aligns with the PICO elements of the review, but the clarity of the search concepts is compromised due to the excessive use of synonyms and variations, which may lead to confusion. While the strategy includes all PICO elements, the breadth of the search is too wide, potentially retrieving irrelevant records. Additionally, the complexity of the strategy is not well explained, which could hinder reproducibility."

        }
      ],
      "justification": "The search strategy contains excessive use of OR and AND operators without effective nesting, leading to a convoluted structure that may result in irrelevant results. The lack of proximity operators and phrase searching diminishes precision, and the overall complexity may hinder the retrieval of relevant studies. Additionally, the absence of NOT operators means there are no unintended exclusions, but the strategy could benefit from clearer and more focused terms."

      "justification": "The search strategy includes a large number of relevant terms, but it lacks appropriate use of subject headings, leading to potential gaps in retrieval. Many relevant subject headings are missing, and the existing ones are not effectively utilized, which could result in an overly broad or narrow search. Additionally, the absence of subheadings and the failure to explode terms where necessary further complicate the search strategy."

      "justification": "The search strategy demonstrates strengths in including synonyms and appropriate truncation, but it lacks consideration for spelling variants and may be overly broad in keyword selection, which could lead to irrelevant results. Additionally, the long search string could benefit from being broken into shorter, more manageable components for clarity and efficiency."

      "justification": "The search strategy lacks appropriate limits and filters relevant to the systematic review's focus on vitamin D supplementation and its effects on falls, fractures, and mortality in adults and the elderly. There are no specific filters for study design (e.g., RCTs), which is crucial given the objective. Additionally, the strategy is overly broad, including many irrelevant terms and concepts that may dilute the search results. There are no citations provided for the filters used, which is a significant oversight."
