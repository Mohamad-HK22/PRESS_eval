      "justification": "The search strategy does not adequately match the PICO elements, particularly in its focus on population and outcomes, leading to unclear concepts. It includes excessive terms related to the population, making it overly broad, while the intervention and outcomes are not sufficiently targeted. The search retrieves an overwhelming number of records, indicating a lack of specificity, and there is no explanation of any unconventional strategies used."

      ],
      "justification": "The search strategy contains excessive use of OR operators and poorly structured nesting, leading to a lack of clarity and potential retrieval of irrelevant results. The absence of effective proximity operators and phrase searching diminishes precision, while the overall complexity may result in missed relevant studies due to the overwhelming number of terms and combinations used."

Additionally, there are missing relevant subject headings, particularly for specific outcomes like falls and fractures. The use of subheadings is inadequate, and there is a lack of appropriate floating subheadings. Overall, the strategy needs refinement to better align with the review's objectives."
