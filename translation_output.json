  "justification": "The search strategy does not adequately match the research question as it lacks a clear focus on the specific outcomes of falls, fractures, and mortality in the context of vitamin D supplementation. The concepts are overly broad, leading to potential retrieval of irrelevant records. Additionally, the complexity of the strategy is not well explained, which may hinder reproducibility and clarity."
